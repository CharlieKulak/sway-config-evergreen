# THIS IS NOT PERFECT. YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE SOME DETAILS IN THE SWAY CONFIG 
for instance, you WILL have to change swaybg where to find your wallpapers, and display stuff. it is currently set to 1920x1080@165 because THATS my monitor, please change that if its different.
# How to install
All you really have to do is:
  1) install the following programs:
    alacritty
    waybar
    rofi
    swaybg
    sway
    swaync
    grim
    slurp
    flatpak
  3) replace the folders in your ~/.config folder with the folders/files in the repo
  4) do a quick
  ```
  chmod +x install.sh # inside your ~/.config folder
  ```
  4) then just do this. Again, this script is not perfect, it only does simple stuff. I can not write bash for my life.
  ```
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```
And your done! reboot your computer and it will look all nice and foresty >;)
```
sudo reboot now
```
